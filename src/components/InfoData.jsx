        <p>
        This web-app is based on the popular Minecraft game and, in particular, a technique called "Kohi click." This technique involves clicking rapidly to improve performance in the game. 
        <br />
        I n Minecraft 1.7 and 1.8, click speed is an important way to judge players' skills, especially in PvP games where a good click speed is necessary to attack opponents. CPS (clicks per second) tests are used to measure click speed and improve it through practice on the website. So, test your clicking skills on our website and improve your performance in Minecraft!

        <h2>How is CPS measured?</h2>
        <p>
        CPS (clicks per second) is the name given to the measure of the speed of your clicks. The faster you click during a certain interval of time, the higher you can expect your CPS to increase. CPS calculates the average number of clicks compared to the number of seconds in the test. This means that the shorter the interval of time, the more accurate CPS results you will receive. As seconds go by, it becomes increasingly difficult to maintain a stable click speed as muscles contract and tire, reducing your abilities. It is estimated that beyond 10 seconds, your click speed abilities are not optimized and the results do not reflect your true potential.
