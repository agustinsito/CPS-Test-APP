# Project Overview
This project is a web app that measures a user's click speed (CPS, clicks per second) within a 10-second timeframe. It provides users with a click box where they can repeatedly click during the designated time. At the end of the time period, the app calculates and displays the user's CPS score and assigns "‚≠ê" rating based on their performance.

The main purpose of this application is to showcase web development skills and demonstrate the ability to implement interactive features using React. Additionally, it serves as a fun tool for users to measure and compare their click speed. The application also focuses on providing a visually pleasing user experience with a clean design, including a dark mode feature.
